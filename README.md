Welcome to WeatherApp

IMPORTANT! 
Before use, you will need to supply your WeatherAPI key.
A free account can be created at:
https://www.weatherapi.com/

When you have your key, open up file "WeatherApiEndpoint.swift" and replace the "YOUR_API_KEY" string on line 10 with your API key.

WeatherApp is now ready to run!

Compile and run on an iOS simulator or physical device, and enter your location to view current weather.

The Preview pane will use mock data to populate the fields. No need to hit the live API over and over while you're doing dev work!
